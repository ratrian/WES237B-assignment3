# Assignment 3
The focus of this assignment is to take your matrix multiplication from Assignment 2 and adapt it to run on OpenCL.

## Lab
The focus of this lab is to provide tools for debugging OpenCL applications on device.

### Pocl
This portion of the lab is to be an introduction to the debugging tool POCL.  For the steps for this, see `./lab/pocl/README.md`.

## Homework
The goal of this is to accelerate your matrix multiply from Assignment 2.

### OpenCL Naive MM
The first part of this homework assignment is to adapt your naive matrix multiplication to OpenCL.  For the steps for this, see `./homework/opencl_naive_mm/README.md`.

### OpenCL Tiled MM
The second part of this homework is to take your OpenCL naive matrix multiplication and apply OpenCL optimizations.  For the steps for this, see `./homework/opencl_tiled_mm`.
